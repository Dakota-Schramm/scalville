The Carolina Reaper holds the Guinness World Record for the hottest pepper. It was selectively bred for heat by crossing a Pakistani Naga pepper with a Red Habanero. Originating in South Carolina, this pepper boasts a scorching heat that peaks around 1.6 million SHU. Its flavor, amid the searing heat, offers a surprising initial sweetness followed by an intense spiciness, often accompanied by subtle fruity notes. Widely used in hot sauces and spicy food challenges, the Carolina Reaper is not for the faint-hearted.
