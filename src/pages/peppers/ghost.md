Originating from Northeast India, the Ghost Pepper, or Bhut Jolokia, was once the hottest pepper globally before the Carolina Reaper took the crown. Ranking over 1,000,000 SHU, this pepper offers an intense and enduring burn accompanied by a smoky and subtly fruity flavor. Despite its searing heat, it's a popular choice in both culinary and defense use, often found in traditional curries, hot sauces, and even pepper sprays due to its extreme spiciness.
